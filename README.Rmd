## Navigation

Welcome to the Successful Employment for Iowans with Disabilities project page! This is the home for all of the dashboards and documentation that the DSPG 2022 team worked to complete.  

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DSPG-2022/DHR-Disabilities")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
