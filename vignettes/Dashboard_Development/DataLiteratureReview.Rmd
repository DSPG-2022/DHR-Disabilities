## General Introduction

An important consideration of the Successful Employment for Iowans with Disabilities project was its focus on reviewing as many accessible data sources as potentially possible within the time-frame of the DSPG program. The result of this was a survey of data sets that focused on Iowans with disabilities and exploring whether the information contained could be used to provide insight to persons with disabilities and employment in Iowa.

## Datasets Utilized

### American Census Survey (ACS)

Of all the data sources pertaining to persons with a disability (PWD) in Iowa, the ACS includes the most fundamental and complete data set for providing a contextual overview to PWDs. For this reason, this section will document how the ACS data is structured for this particular project.

#### Difficulty Types
In the sections which pertain to disability, the ACS primary collects data on six different kinds of difficulty.


-	Hearing
-	Vision
-	Cognitive
-	Ambulatory
-	Self-care
-	Independent Living 


#### Table Codes and Corresponding Information
On questions of Employment & Income, B18120, B18121, B18140, contain information on: 

-	Employment Status by Disability Status and Type, 
-	Work Experience by Disability Status and Type,
-	Median Earnings by Disability Status by Sex for the Civilian Noninstitutionalized Population with Earnings

On questions of Poverty, B18130, B18131, B21007, B23024 contain information on:

-	Age by Disability Status by Poverty Status
-	Age by Ratio of Income to Poverty Level by Disability Status and Type
-	Age by Veteran Status by Poverty Status by Disability Status for the Civilian Population 18 Years and Over
-	Poverty Status by Disability Status by Employment Status for the Population 20 to 64 Years

On questions of Insurance & Service, B18135, B21100, B22010 contain information on: 

-	Age by Disability Status by Health Insurance Coverage Status
- Service-connected Disability-rating Status and Ratings for Civilian Veterans 18 Years and Over
-	Receipt of Food Stamps/SNAP by Disability Status for Households

On questions regarding General Age and Sex can be found from B18101 – B18107. Additionally on the question of Age, B18108, B26108, B26208 contain information on:

-	 Age by Number of Disabilities
-	Group Quarters Type (3 Types) by Age by Disability Status
-	Group Quarters Type (5 Types) by Age by Disability Status

One Miscellaneous Category is B10052, which contains information on:

-	Disability Status of Grandparents Living with Own Grandchildren by Responsibility for Own Grandchildren and Age of Grandparent


#### Questions in the ACS Questionnaires 

Tables that are outside of the difficulties categories are created using a combination of different questions of the ACS Questionnaires. Employment information for Persons with Disabilities comes from a combination of the Employment, Poverty, Commute, and Disability answers that surveyors respond to when filling the questionnaire.

##### Questions on Disability (Yes/No Questions)

a.	Is this person deaf or does he/she have serious difficulty hearing?

### [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://idph.iowa.gov/brfss/Data-by-County)

This data set was used as a comparative supplement to the ACS data set. It contains information matching ACS questionnaires on Disability Status, Age and Type. The geographic scope of this survey is by the county level and the survey is conducted through telephone.

### [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/data-sources)

For the purposes of this project, we focused exclusively on the survey questions that related to the Mental Health sections. This information was taken from the _National Survey on Drug Use and Health_ and the geographic scope of this data was by sub-state regions rather than county.

### [Iowa Vocational Rehabilitation Services (IVRS)](https://data.iowa.gov/Vocational-Rehabilitation/Closed-Iowa-Vocational-Rehabilitation-Cases/gcya-t3y9) 

For the assessment of public services, the IVRS data set on Closed Iowa Vocational Rehabilitation Cases was an invaluable resource. This data set had two potential geographic information provided about the clients of the IVRS. The first of these are the office locations that the clients were receiving services from. The second was the location of the client at the end of their services. By calculating the number of employment and the changes in wages for each client, we tried to assess how functional the offices were at helping clients with their employment. 

More information on the IVRS data set can be found in the [Services](https://dspg-2022.github.io/DHR-Disabilities/articles/Dashboard_Development/Services.html) section of the documentation. 

### [Iowa’s Mental Health and Disability Services (MHDS)](https://dhs.iowa.gov/mhds-providers/providers-regions/regions)

For the assessment of public expenditures, we relied on the MDHS regional data sets to learn more about Expenditures, Persons Served, and Unduplicated Persons Served by Service. Due to the way that the data is organized, it took a lot of time to be able to collect all of the MHDS regions into one data table, preventing us from looking at all possible years. The geography of this data set is available for MHDS regions which are not as granular as county data but more so than SAMSHA or IVRS regions.

### [Successful Employment for Blind Iowans by Federal Fiscal Year](https://data.iowa.gov/Vocational-Rehabilitation/Successful-Employment-for-Blind-Iowans-by-Federal-/twt2-zx5z)

Another assessment of public services utilized the Successful Employment for Blind Iowans by Federal Fiscal Year data set from the Iowa Data portal. Unfortunately, the data was last updated for the years of 2016 since 2012, but much like the IVRS data, it contains information regarding hourly wage changes and earnings. The data set does not contain any geographical information.

### Iowa Department of Management – [Budgeted](https://data.iowa.gov/Local-Government-Finance/County-Budgeted-Expenditures-By-Service-Area-By-Fi/gk9s-gz9c) and [Actual](https://data.iowa.gov/Local-Government-Finance/County-Actual-Expenditures-by-Service-Area-by-Fisc/fxbr-vb9c) Expenditures by County on Physical Health and Social Services

For county level expenditures, we focused on data that was provided by the Iowa Department of Management which listed both budgeted and actual expenditures for counties in Iowa. Since they were separate data tables, the process was to first clean and merge them together to later map. We focused on two variables for expenditures; Physical Health and Social Services.
