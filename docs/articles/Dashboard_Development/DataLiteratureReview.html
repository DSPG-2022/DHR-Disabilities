</h2>
<p>An important objective of the Successful Employment for Persons with
Disabilities in Iowa project was its focus on reviewing as many
accessible data sources as potentially possible within the time-frame of
the DSPG program. The result of this was a survey of data sets that
focused on Iowans with disabilities and exploring whether the
information contained could be used to provide insight to persons with
disabilities and employment in Iowa.</p>

</h3>
<p>Of all the data sources pertaining to persons with a disability (PWD)
in Iowa, the ACS includes the most fundamental and complete data set for
providing a contextual overview to PWDs. For this reason, this section
will document how the ACS data is structured for this particular
project.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="difficulty-types">Difficulty Types<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#difficulty-types"></a>

<p>In the sections which pertain to disability, the ACS primary collects
data on six different kinds of difficulty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing</li>
<li>Vision</li>
<li>Cognitive</li>
<li>Ambulatory</li>
<li>Self-care</li>

<li>Age by Disability Status by Poverty Status</li>
<li>Age by Ratio of Income to Poverty Level by Disability Status and
Type</li>
<li>Age by Veteran Status by Poverty Status by Disability Status for the
Civilian Population 18 Years and Over</li>
<li>Poverty Status by Disability Status by Employment Status for the
Population 20 to 64 Years</li>
</ul>
<p>On questions of Insurance &amp; Service, B18135, B21100, B22010

<li>Service-connected Disability-rating Status and Ratings for Civilian
Veterans 18 Years and Over</li>
<li>Receipt of Food Stamps/SNAP by Disability Status for Households</li>
</ul>
<p>On questions regarding General Age and Sex can be found from B18101 –
B18107. Additionally on the question of Age, B18108, B26108, B26208
contain information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age by Number of Disabilities</li>
<li>Group Quarters Type (3 Types) by Age by Disability Status</li>
<li>Group Quarters Type (5 Types) by Age by Disability Status</li>
</ul>
<p>One Miscellaneous Category is B10052, which contains information

<ul>
<li>Disability Status of Grandparents Living with Own Grandchildren by
Responsibility for Own Grandchildren and Age of Grandparent</li>

<p>Tables that are outside of the difficulties categories are created
using a combination of different questions of the ACS Questionnaires.
Employment information for Persons with Disabilities comes from a
combination of the Employment, Poverty, Commute, and Disability answers
that surveyors respond to when filling the questionnaire.</p>

<p>This data set was used as a comparative supplement to the ACS data

<p>For the purposes of this project, we focused exclusively on the

Vocational Rehabilitation Services (IVRS)</a><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#iowa-vocational-rehabilitation-services-ivrs"></a>
</h3>
<p>For the assessment of public services, the IVRS data set on Closed
Iowa Vocational Rehabilitation Cases was an invaluable resource. This
data set had two potential geographic information provided about the
clients of the IVRS. The first of these are the office locations that
the clients were receiving services from. The second was the location of
the client at the end of their services. By calculating the number of
employment and the changes in wages for each client, we tried to assess
how functional the offices were at helping clients with their
employment.</p>
<p>More information on the IVRS data set can be found in the <a href="https://dspg-2022.github.io/DHR-Disabilities/articles/Dashboard_Development/Services.html" class="external-link">Services</a>

</h3>
<p>For the assessment of public expenditures, we relied on the MDHS
regional data sets to learn more about Expenditures, Persons Served, and
Unduplicated Persons Served by Service. Due to the way that the data is
organized, it took a lot of time to be able to collect all of the MHDS
regions into one data table, preventing us from looking at all possible
years. The geography of this data set is available for MHDS regions
which are not as granular as county data but more so than SAMSHA or IVRS
regions.</p>

<p>Another assessment of public services utilized the Successful
Employment for Blind Iowans by Federal Fiscal Year data set from the
Iowa Data portal. Unfortunately, the data was last updated for the years
of 2016 since 2012, but much like the IVRS data, it contains information
regarding hourly wage changes and earnings. The data set does not

<p>For county level expenditures, we focused on data that was provided
by the Iowa Department of Management which listed both budgeted and
actual expenditures for counties in Iowa. Since they were separate data
tables, the process was to first clean and merge them together to later
map. We focused on two variables for expenditures; Physical Health and
Social Services.</p>
